  This is my blog where, I write and explore topics if find really amazing and interesting.
  I mainly will write on 4 categories eventually

   - AI: Mainly as understanding these systems is fascinating and interesting.
   - Evolution: The grand question is eventually how we came to be here and where will be in the future.
   - Energy and Power: The advancement of any civilization of any type is build upon their energy consumption to my beliefs. So i will be writing on that some times.
   - Social Networks: Lastly the evolution of communication interfaces for civilization has been interesting over time. So I will be writing stuff on this.

  Eventually This arent the only topics I will be exploring, I might eventually write on other topics i find intersting at time.


  NOTE: Mostly some blogs will be covering some of these things no one knows the answer. So eventually feel free to check out other sources of Info.
